<ul>
  <li>Measures get aggregated, and dimensions specify the level of granularity.</li>
  <li>To remove aggregation (to plot every single row of a data set separately on a chart): Analysis -> Aggregate Measures (unchecked) -> Shape.</li>
  <li>Instead of switching aggregation off, we can introduce a dimension that will change the granularity level of our dashboard and, therefore, affect the aggregation. So we're going to take gender, and we're going to drag it on to colour. And right away, you can see here that we have twice as many dots. We have made the chart more detailed by adding a new dimension.</li>
