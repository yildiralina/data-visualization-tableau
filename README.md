<ul>
  <li>Measures get aggregated, and dimensions specify the level of granularity.</li>
  <li>To remove aggregation (to plot every single row of a data set separately on a chart): Analysis -> Aggregate Measures (unchecked) -> Shape.</li>
  <li>Instead of switching aggregation off, we can introduce a dimension that will change the granularity level of our dashboard and, therefore, affect the aggregation.</li>
</ul>
