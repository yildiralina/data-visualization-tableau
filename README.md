<ul>
  <li>Measures get aggregated, and dimensions specify the level of granularity.</li>
  <li>To remove aggregation (to plot every single row of our data set separately on this chart): Analysis -> Aggregate Measures (unchecked) -> Shape.</li>
  <li>Instead of switching aggregation off, we can introduce a dimension which will change the level of granularity of our dashboard and therefore it will affect the aggregation.</li>
</ul>
